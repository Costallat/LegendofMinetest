Gameplay information:
In addition to the usual mining and building objectives of the game, there are now bosses and the triforce as objectives.
The triforce can be obtained either by mining mese, searching dungeons, or by defeating Ganon. Scattered throughout the dungeons are triforce shards, and magic pendants. 
These pendants can be used to craft boss spawners. Once placed, the bosses will spawn after 5 seconds. Currently there are three minor bosses, spawned with blocks crafted with the three pendants.
These bosses drop the three stones required to obtain the mastersword, which will turn any boss spawner into a Ganon spawner when right clicked. 
The bosses are tough so be prepared! Also, in an attempt to break away from the usual mining aspect, some materials can be traded with npc's.

--readme of Minetest Game
Minetest Game [minetest_game]
=============================
The main subgame for the Minetest engine
========================================

To use this subgame with the Minetest engine, insert this repository as
	/games/minetest_game

The Minetest engine can be found in:
	https://github.com/minetest/minetest/

Compatibility
--------------
The Minetest Game github master HEAD is generally compatible with the github
master HEAD of the Minetest engine.

Additionally, when the Minetest engine is tagged to be a certain version (eg.
0.4.10), Minetest Game is tagged with the version too.

When stable releases are made, Minetest Game is packaged and made available in
	http://minetest.net/download
and in case the repository has grown too much, it may be reset. In that sense,
this is not a "real" git repository. (Package maintainers please note!)
