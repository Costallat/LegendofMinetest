Gameplay information:
In addition to the usual mining and building objectives of the game, there are now bosses and the triforce as objectives.
The triforce can be obtained either by mining mese, searching dungeons, or by defeating Ganon. Scattered throughout the dungeons are triforce shards, and magic pendants. 
These pendants can be used to craft boss spawners. Once placed, the bosses will spawn after 5 seconds. Currently there are three minor bosses, spawned with blocks crafted with the three pendants.
These bosses drop the three stones required to obtain the mastersword, which will turn any boss spawner into a Ganon spawner when right clicked. 
The bosses are tough so be prepared! Also, in an attempt to break away from the usual mining aspect, some materials can be traded with npc's.
